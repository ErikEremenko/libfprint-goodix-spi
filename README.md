## Supported devices

- Goodix GDIX51C0 <sup>* tested on Huawei Matebook 16s</sup>

> [!NOTE]\
> For details, see the [support matrix](docs/SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md)
> and [current parity record](re/PARITY.md)

## Known limitations

- This is a pre-release. The driver has only been hardware-tested on the
  machine listed above, and packaging or integration details may still change.
  The driver id, storage paths, and enrolled-print format are treated as stable.
- GDIX51C0 is currently the only supported sensor and has been hardware-tested
  on a Huawei MateBook 16s.
- The default GPIO lines match the tested machine. Other laptops using the same
  sensor may require the `GDIX51C0_GPIOCHIP`, `GDIX51C0_IRQ_LINE`, and
  `GDIX51C0_RESET_LINE` overrides.
- The sensor must be exposed through Linux spidev; this project does not install
  a custom kernel driver.
- Integration is tested against the pinned libfprint and fprintd versions. Newer
  releases may require the integration patches to be updated.

## Security model

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> This sensor streams images to the host, and all matching runs on the host CPU.
> It is not a match-on-chip or secure-element design, and it cannot be made into
> one: the hardware has no command to store a template or match a finger.

- **A compromised host defeats it.** An attacker with root or kernel access can
  bypass authentication and read biometric data. Fingerprint unlock here defends
  against physical and opportunistic access to your machine, not against malware
  that is already running as you.
- **No liveness detection.** The sensor's raw anti-spoofing signals are never
  exposed to the host, so this driver cannot perform presentation-attack
  detection. A good fake finger may pass.
- **Templates and keys sit on disk.** Enrolled prints and the TLS PSK live under
  `/var/lib/fprint` protected only by filesystem permissions (`0600`).
- **What the native matcher does buy you** is a much lower false-accept rate than
  a generic image matcher achieves on a sensor this small — that is, the wrong
  finger is far less likely to unlock your machine.

Use fingerprint unlock as a convenience factor, not as your only line of
defense.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer:

1. Fetches pinned libfprint and fprintd sources into
   `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/goodix-spi-driver/sources`,
2. Applies the libfprint and fprintd integration patches,
3. Builds a shadow libfprint under
   `/opt/goodix-spi-driver/libfprint`,
4. Builds the patched fprintd under `/opt/goodix-spi-driver/fprintd`,
5. Configures fprintd to use both shadow builds and prewarm GDIX51C0,
6. Restarts the daemon.

> [!WARNING]\
> The default installation patches fprintd so successful adaptive
> `templateStudy` updates are saved to disk and the sensor can initialize in
> the background. The current Chicago template can retain up to 50 captures.
> Use `./install.sh --without-fprintd` to keep the distribution fprintd; this
> disables both persistence of learning updates and background warm sessions.

<br>

The supported defaults are libfprint `v1.94.10` and fprintd `v1.94.5`. A
different libfprint checkout can be supplied directly:

```bash
./install.sh /path/to/libfprint
```

or fetched into a separate cache entry:

```bash
LIBFPRINT_REF=<tag-or-commit> ./scripts/fetch-libfprint.sh
```

Build dependencies include GLib/GIO, GUsb, GUdev, `libgpiod >= 2.0`, and
`OpenSSL >= 3.0`. The default patched fprintd build also requires Polkit's
GObject development files (`polkit-gobject-1 >= 0.91`). Verbose libfprint
diagnostics are disabled by default. Use
`GOODIX_SPI_DEBUG=1 ./install.sh` only for a debugging session.

### Developer builds

Normal builds do not contain capture dump writers, protocol tuning knobs, or
fault-injection hooks. To compile those tools for driver development:

```bash
GOODIX_SPI_DEVELOPER=1 GOODIX_SPI_DEBUG=1 ./install.sh
```

Developer diagnostics can write biometric captures and should not be left
enabled on an everyday installation. Runtime dump variables have no effect on
the default release build. CI checks both build profiles and rejects a release
library that still contains a developer hook.

## First run

The sensor also requires a 32-byte TLS PSK. If no key is supplied, the default
installation authorizes one random first-run provision and stores it as
`/var/lib/fprint/gdix51c0.psk` with mode `0600`. To use an existing key:

```bash
GOODIX_TLS_PSK_HEX=<64-hex> ./install.sh
```

> [!NOTE]\
> On a dual-boot system, an existing Windows key can be imported. If Linux and
> Windows use different keys, either OS may replace the key stored by the
> sensor. After a confirmed TLS authentication mismatch, Linux restores its
> persisted key once after a hard reset. The first fingerprint operation after
> switching operating systems may therefore take a little longer.

## Enroll and verify

Enroll a finger after installation:

```bash
fprintd-enroll -f right-index-finger
```

Then test it:

```bash
fprintd-verify
```

The [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains the abstraction boundaries;
the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) covers additional sensors.

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Use `./uninstall.sh --purge` only when the persisted PSK and sensor calibration
should also be removed.

This project is maintained out of tree today. Parts of the driver may
eventually be suitable for libfprint, but that is a possibility rather than a
promised distribution path. The SPI integration and adaptive-template
persistence would first need to be agreed with the libfprint and fprintd
maintainers.
